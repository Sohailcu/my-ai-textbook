# Physical AI & Humanoid Robotics — Essentials Constitution

## Core Principles

### Simplicity
Content and implementation must be simple and accessible; Focus on minimal, essential concepts; Complex topics broken into digestible parts

### Accuracy
All technical content must be factually correct and verified; Code examples tested and validated; Citations and sources properly attributed

### Minimalism
Concise chapters without unnecessary content; Clean, lightweight UI with minimal dependencies; No feature bloat

### Fast builds
Optimize build times for rapid iteration; Lightweight embeddings and processing; Efficient compilation pipelines

### Free-tier architecture
All infrastructure must operate within free tier limits; No heavy GPU compute requirements; Cost-effective solutions prioritized

### RAG answers ONLY from book text
Chatbot responses constrained to textbook content only; No hallucinations or external information; Strict adherence to source material

## Technology Constraints
No heavy GPU usage; Minimal embeddings; Docusaurus for UI; Qdrant + Neon + FastAPI for RAG; Support for optional Urdu/Personalize features

## Development Workflow
Select-text → Ask AI feature implementation; Smooth GitHub Pages deployment; Build success verification; Clean UI delivery

## Governance
All PRs must verify build success and accurate chatbot functionality; Simplicity must be maintained; Complexity must be justified with clear benefits
